# This is such a god awful way of doing this kind of thing. Everything until "exitcode()" is basically just
# 1: Check if the token.txt file (the file that contains a Discord token) exists. This was purely made so I don't accidentally commit my bot token to the repo
# 2: If the file doesn't exist, write "This is where you put the bot's Discord token. Replace all the text here with just your token." to exit the script in such an awful way
# 2.5: If the file does exist, it prints the token and start the bot
# 3 Verify the contents of token.txt. If it contains "This is where you put the bot's Discord token. Replace all the text here with just your token.", exit the script.
